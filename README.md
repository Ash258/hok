## Install

ðŸš§ **CAVEAT**: Under heavy development, interfaces may change without notice.

Assuming you have the original Scoop installed, simply run:

```sh
scoop bucket add dorado https://github.com/chawyehsu/dorado
scoop install dorado/hok
```

Note this will add the `dorado` bucket I maintain to install Hok. Hok is experimental and it's currently only available in that bucket.

## Commands

The command line interface is similar to Scoop.

```

## Performance

Hok (also the libscoop backend) aims to provide a faster yet powerful alternative
to the original Scoop. Here are some random benchmarks tested with v0.1.0-beta.2
in a Windows Sandbox environment on my PC (AMD Ryzen 5 2600, Windows 10).
